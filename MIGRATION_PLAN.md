# Database Migration & Infrastructure Build Plan

## Overview
Complete migration from JSON to SQLite database with full performance tracking and backtesting capabilities.

## Phase 1: Database Migration (SQLite)

### 1.1 Database Schema Design
- [ ] Create SQLite database file
- [ ] Design normalized schema:
  - `predictions` table (id, date, strategy, ticker, position, confidence, target, timeframe)
  - `trades` table (id, prediction_id, entry_date, entry_price, exit_date, exit_price, status, pnl)
  - `strategies` table (id, name, description, min_hold_days, max_hold_days)
  - `tickers` table (id, symbol, name, sector, market_cap)
  - `price_history` table (id, ticker_id, date, open, high, low, close, volume)
  - `performance_metrics` table (id, strategy_id, date, accuracy, sharpe, max_drawdown, total_return)
  - `volume_leaders` table (id, date, timeframe, rank, ticker_id, volume, price)
  - `backtest_results` table (id, strategy_id, start_date, end_date, total_return, sharpe, max_dd, trades)

### 1.2 Migration Scripts
- [ ] Create database initialization script
- [ ] Build JSON to SQLite migrator for:
  - predictions_data.json
  - trades_data.json
  - volume_leaders_*.json
  - historical price data
- [ ] Add data validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Create rollback capability

### 1.3 Database API Layer
- [ ] Create DatabaseManager class
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Build query optimization
- [ ] Add transaction support
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality

## Phase 2: Performance Tracking System

### 2.1 Real-Time Tracking
- [ ] Track prediction timestamp
- [ ] Record entry signals
- [ ] Monitor exit conditions
- [ ] Calculate real-time P&L
- [ ] Track slippage and fees
- [ ] Store performance metrics

### 2.2 Performance Analytics
- [ ] Calculate per-strategy metrics:
  - Win rate
  - Average win/loss
  - Profit factor
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Recovery time
- [ ] Generate daily/weekly/monthly reports
- [ ] Compare to benchmark (SPY)
- [ ] Risk-adjusted returns

### 2.3 Performance Dashboard
- [ ] Create HTML dashboard
- [ ] Real-time performance charts
- [ ] Strategy comparison view
- [ ] Historical performance graphs
- [ ] Export to PDF/Excel

## Phase 3: Backtesting Engine

### 3.1 Backtesting Framework
- [ ] Historical data loader
- [ ] Strategy execution simulator
- [ ] Order execution model:
  - Market orders
  - Limit orders
  - Stop losses
  - Take profits
- [ ] Commission/slippage model
- [ ] Position sizing rules

### 3.2 Walk-Forward Analysis
- [ ] In-sample optimization
- [ ] Out-of-sample testing
- [ ] Rolling window backtests
- [ ] Parameter sensitivity
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation

### 3.3 Risk Metrics
- [ ] Value at Risk (VaR)
- [ ] Conditional VaR
- [ ] Beta to market
- [ ] Correlation analysis
- [ ] Stress testing

### 3.4 Reporting
- [ ] Detailed trade log
- [ ] Equity curve visualization
- [ ] Drawdown analysis
- [ ] Monthly returns table
- [ ] Strategy comparison reports

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing

### 4.1 System Integration
- [ ] Update predictors to use database
- [ ] Modify web interface for database
- [ ] Update volume universe system
- [ ] Integrate performance tracking

### 4.2 Testing Suite
- [ ] Unit tests for database operations
- [ ] Integration tests for full pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Data integrity verification
- [ ] Stress testing with large datasets

### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Database schema docs
- [ ] User guide for backtesting
- [ ] Performance metrics glossary

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (Database setup and migration)
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (Performance tracking)
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours (Backtesting engine)
- Phase 4: 1-2 hours (Integration and testing)

Total estimated time: 8-12 hours

## Success Criteria
1. All JSON data successfully migrated to SQLite
2. Zero data loss during migration
3. Performance tracking operational for all strategies
4. Backtesting produces reproducible results
5. System handles 10+ years of historical data efficiently
6. Web interface continues working seamlessly
7. Automated reports generated successfully

## Rollback Plan
- Keep all original JSON files
- Database backup before each major change
- Version control for all code changes
- Ability to switch between JSON/SQLite modes
