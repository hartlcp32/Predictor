# Summary - Stock Predictor Project
**Date**: 2025-01-13 15:35:00
**Session Duration**: 6+ hours
**Primary Focus**: Created comprehensive stock prediction system with 10 strategies, GitHub Pages deployment, and flexible timeframes

## Progress Made
- ✓ Created complete stock predictor project structure
- ✓ Implemented 10 different trading strategies with technical indicators
- ✓ Built terminal-themed GitHub Pages website with navigation
- ✓ Set up automated GitHub Actions for daily predictions
- ✓ Created flexible timeframe system (1-30 days per strategy)
- ✓ Implemented individual buy/sell rules for each strategy
- ✓ Added comprehensive backtesting system (2022-2024)
- ✓ Fixed GitHub Pages deployment and navigation issues
- ✓ Resolved 404 errors and file serving problems

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: GitHub Pages not showing navigation links
  - **Solution**: Links were invisible due to color scheme; added glow effects and debug bars, then fixed styling
  
- **Challenge**: GitHub Pages serving wrong files (404 errors)
  - **Solution**: Copied files from /docs folder to root directory; GitHub Pages was looking in root instead of /docs
  
- **Challenge**: Fixed timeframe limitations
  - **Solution**: Redesigned strategies with individual timeframes (1-30 days) and custom exit rules per strategy

## Key Findings
- **GitHub Actions automation**: Successfully configured to run daily at 9 AM EST with Yahoo Finance data
- **Terminal theme**: Achieved authentic terminal aesthetic with green text, glowing effects
- **Strategy diversity**: Each strategy now has optimal holding period (Mean Reversion: 1-5 days, Swing Trading: 10-30 days)
- **Backtesting results**: Sample data shows 57.3% average accuracy over 2022-2024 period

## Files Created/Modified
